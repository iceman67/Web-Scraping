1. Import some packages
‘requests’ calling ‘import requests’
‘BeautifulSoup’ calling ‘from bs4 import BeautifulSoup’'

from bs4 import BeautifulSoup
import requests
 
2. We can access the webpage HTML code by doing[Chrome]:
Right-click > Inspect
Or either in Mac pressing Command+shift+c

3. Instantiate a ‘requests’ object with the URL and optional parameters through the request.
url = ‘https://www.penguin.co.uk/articles/2018/100-must-read-classic-books/'
r = requests.get(url)

4. Create the BeautifulSoup object to pass our request text through its HTML parser: 
soup = BeautifulSoup(r.text,’html.parser’)

5. Find all the ‘cmp-text text’ elements in the code
for book in soup.find_all(‘div’, attrs={'class': 'cmp-text text'})
