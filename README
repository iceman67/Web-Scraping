‘requests’ calling ‘import requests’
‘BeautifulSoup’ calling ‘from bs4 import BeautifulSoup’


[Chrome] We can access the webpage HTML code by doing:
Right-click > Inspect
Or either in Mac pressing Command+shift+c



Instantiate a ‘requests’ object with the URL and optional parameters through the request.

url = ‘https://www.penguin.co.uk/articles/2018/100-must-read-classic-books/'
r = requests.get(url)

Create the BeautifulSoup object to pass our request text through its HTML parser: 

soup = BeautifulSoup(r.text,’html.parser’)
